I faced several challenges during the development process. Here's a breakdown of the difficulties I encountered:

Understanding Card Values: Initially, grasping the concept of assigning values to different cards was challenging. I had to figure out how to represent cards with values ranging from 2 to 10, as well as face cards like Jack, Queen, and King, each with a value of 10. Additionally, the Ace card posed a challenge due to its flexible value of either 1 or 11, depending on the player's hand.

Implementing Game Logic: Translating the rules of Blackjack into code logic was another hurdle. I needed to ensure that the game followed the standard rules, such as dealing cards to the player and dealer, calculating scores, determining winners, and handling scenarios like player busts and dealer busts.

UI Updates and Interaction: Creating a user-friendly interface that accurately displayed the player's and dealer's cards, scores, and game messages was a significant challenge. I had to constantly update the UI based on the game state, such as when the player hits or stands or when the game ends.

Testing and Debugging: Throughout the development process, I encountered numerous bugs and logical errors that required thorough testing and debugging. Ensuring that the game functioned correctly under various scenarios, including edge cases like tie games or multiple rounds, was crucial for delivering a stable product.

Despite these challenges, developing the Blackjack game was a valuable learning experience. It helped me improve my problem-solving skills, understand game development concepts, and gain confidence in coding interactive applications.
